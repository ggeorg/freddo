#summary Discover-and-Talk is a server less messaging protocol that allows any two entities to negotiate a server less connection in order to exchange messages.

<wiki:toc/>

= Introduction =

This specification is similar to [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html Link-Local XMPP]. The specification defines how to communicate over local or wide-area networks using the principles of zero-configuration for endpoint discovery and the syntax of JSON objects and [MessagingProtocol JSON based messaging] for real time communication. DTalk uses DNS-based Service Discovery and Multicast DNS to discover entities that support the protocol, including their IP addresses and preferred ports.

Serverless messaging is typically restricted to a local network (or ad-hoc wide-area network) because of how zero-configuration works.

= Details =

This section provides a friendly introduction to DTalk.

For a concrete example, consider a hypothetical device that shares music over a local network - an IP - enabled jukebox. Suppose that its transport protocol is TCP and its application protocol goes by the name "music". When someone plugs the device into an Ethernet hub, a number of things happen, as show in figure 1.

In step 1, the device randomly selects the link-local IP address 169.254.150.84, randomly selected from IPv4 link-local range 169.254.0.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, and announces it to the network. Because no devices respond to the announcement, the device takes the address as its own.

In step 2, it starts up its own Multicast DNS responder, requests the host name "eds-musicbox.local.", verifies its availability, and takes the name as its own.

In step 3, the device starts up a music sharing service on TCP port 1010.

In step 4, finally, it publishes the service, of type _music._tcp, under the name "Edâ€™s Party Mix", in the "local." domain, first making sure that no service exists under the same name. This creates two records:

 * An SRV record named `_Ed's Party Mix._music._tcp.local.` that points to `eds-musicbox.local.` on TCP port `1010`.
 * An PTR record named `_music._tcp.local.` that points to the `_Ed's Party Mix._music._tcp.local.` service.
