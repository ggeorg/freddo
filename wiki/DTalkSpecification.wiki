#summary DTalk is a simple JSON-based messaging protocol designed for working with message-oriented middleware.

= Introduction =

DTalk arose from a need to allow a mobile app developer to access native device services such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript as well as device-to-device communication.

Over time DTalk has matured into a protocol which can be used past these simple use cases, but still maintains its core design principles of simplicity and interoperability.

= Details =

DTalk is similar to JSON-RPC.

The general mechanism consists of two peers establishing a data connection. During the lifetime of a connection, peers may invoke actions provided by the other peer. To invoke a remote action, a request is sent. Unless the request is a notification it must be replied to with a response.

== Request ==

A remote action is requested by sending a request object to a remote service. The request object has the following members:

|| dtalk || A string specifying the version of the DTalk protocol (currently "1.0"). ||
|| action || A string containing the name of the requested action. ||
|| params || A structured value that holds the parameter values to be used during the processing of the requested action ||
|| id || An identifier established by the client that MUST contain a string if included. If 'id' is not included it is assumed to be a notification. Id 'id' is included, the remote service MUST reply with the same value in the response object. ||
