#summary Discover-and-Talk is a server less messaging protocol that allows any two entities to negotiate a server less connection in order to exchange messages.

= Introduction =

This specification is similar to [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html Link-Local XMPP]. The specification defines how to communicate over local or wide-area networks using the principles of zero-configuration for endpoint discovery and the syntax of JSON objects and JSON based messaging for real time communication. DTalk uses DNS-based Service Discovery and Multicast DNS to discover entities that support the protocol, including their IP addresses and preferred ports.

Serverless messaging is typically restricted to a local network (or ad-hoc wide-area network) because of how zero-configuration works.

This section provides a friendly introduction to DTalk.

For a concrete example, consider a hypothetical device that shares music over a local network - an IP - enabled jukebox. Suppose that its transport protocol is TCP and its application protocol goes by the name "music". When someone plugs the device into an Ethernet hub, a number of things happen, as show in figure 1:
